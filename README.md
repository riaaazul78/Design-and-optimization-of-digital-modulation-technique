# Design-and-optimization-of-digital-modulation-technique
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and performance optimization of two key digital modulation techniques â€” Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) and Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK). Using MATLAB/Simulink or equivalent tools, both modulation schemes are modeled to analyze bit error rate (BER), bandwidth efficiency, and signal constellation.

The study highlights that OQPSK reduces phase transitions and minimizes signal distortion compared to QPSK, making it more suitable for high-speed wireless communication. Optimization is achieved through parameter tuning such as filter design and power efficiency improvement.
